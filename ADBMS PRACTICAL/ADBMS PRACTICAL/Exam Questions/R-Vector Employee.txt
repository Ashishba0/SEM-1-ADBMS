1. Create a folder named "RPractical" in your home directory/C: drive.
2. Set the working directory to this folder.
3. Create 4 vectors EmployeeID, EmployeeName, EmployeeDept and
EmployeeSalary with some meaningful data.
4. Create a dataframe with 4 variable names namely EmployeeID,
EmployeeName, EmployeeDept and EmployeeSalary.
5. Print data frame.
6. Rename variables (columns) of dataframe to the names of your choice.
7. Assign some valid row names to data frame and print it
